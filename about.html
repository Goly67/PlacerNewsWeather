                <h4>Octa News was born out of the passion to share news stories that are informative, and yet behind the actual news, meaning that their significance often goes underreported in mainstream media. Founded by one enthusiastic individual interested in providing a source for a variety of voices and perspectives, Octa News serves as a personal project, always giving value over quantity. Independent, flexible structure allows the founder to penetrate niche topics in unique ways and challenge the status quo. An informal company structure lacks the resources and access to large sources, but on the other hand, there is more personal ownership and dedication: each piece written truly reflects the goal of journalistic integrity and pursuit of the truth.</h4>
